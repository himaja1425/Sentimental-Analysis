# Sentimental-Analysis
            
Implemented Sentiment Analysis utilizing the Naive Bayes algorithm for classifying text data into 
positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Employed Python's scikit-learn library for model 
implementation and NLTK for text preprocessing. Utilized bag-of-words or TF-IDF representation for feature extraction, enabling effective sentiment classification. Trained the model on a diverse dataset of labelled text samples from various domains. Evaluated model performance using standard 
metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project showcases proficiency in machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis tasks. 

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn (for implementing Naive Bayes algorithm and preprocessing), NLTK (for text processing), pandas (for data manipulation)
